I can't commit everything to github, so please go to /fs/ess/PAS2880/users/bateman139/final_project in vscode to see the file organization and results.

The R_analysis.qmd file is a continuation of the README into R studio. 

There is a lack of commits in this repository as this is the final submission repo. For the past commits, see project in my repos.
